# Wallpapers and sort-rename script

This repo has interesting wallpapers based on my tastes and a script that renames the pictures in numerically order, also testing my expertise in this topics

## Requisites

- Git installed, if you don't have it, follow the [Git instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Use terminals, like CMD or any Bash

## Getting Started

Use the following command in some terminal to clone this wallpapers into some folder

```bash
git clone git@github.com:JamesCordova/wallpapers-sort-rename
```

```bash
python main.py
```

## What gonna happen?

After run the main.py if there is new files with some random name, they gonna be renamed as numbers or if there is deleted numbers, others gonna replace them, that's all I think.
